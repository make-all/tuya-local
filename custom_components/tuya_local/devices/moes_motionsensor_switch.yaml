# Example DPS Status
# {"dps": { "1": false, "14": "memory", "15": "relay", "43": false, "44": "on",
# "45": "default", "46": true, "47": "on", "48": "high", "49": 3600, "101": 0,
# "102": 0}
# Additional DPS 44 "Illuminance State" and 47 "Motion State". I couldn't
# figure out what those did, device debugger appears to indicate that these
# were set exactly once (to "on") when the switch was powered on and does NOT
# seem to trigger or respond when Illuminance or Motion trigger is met, but
# maybe I just don't know how to check that well. A final DPS shows up only in
# the Tuya Cloud API: 103 "Timer". There are "timers" in the Smart Life App for
# this device but I couldn't figure out how they work.
# Illuminance Switch: Enables/disables illuminance threshold for motion
#                     activation
# Motion Switch: Enables/disables motion-triggered switch
# Motion Auto-Off Delay: Time in seconds after which to turn off light if
#                        triggered by motion
# Appointment Time: Time of day in minutes when motion switch stops activating,
#                   0 for always
# Target Time: Time of day in minutes when motion switch can activate, 0 for
#              always
