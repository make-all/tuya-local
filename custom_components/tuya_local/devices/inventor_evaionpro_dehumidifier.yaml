    # The following two are documented in the protocol as read/write, and appear
    # in the app to be so.  But there is no mention in the manual of a pump
    # and likely this is an indicator that the compressor is operating.
    # Water level also seems more likely to be an indicator.
    # If known for sure, they can be moved to sensors (or switch/number if
    # they are really configurable)
