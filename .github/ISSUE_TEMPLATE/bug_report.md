This form is for reporting bugs.  If you have encountered a bug, you should
generally have some log messages or device diagnostics to show something is
going wrong.  If your problem is more of a question or a request for help,
then [Discussions](https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local/discussions) is
probably a more suitable venue.


**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior including the device the issue was observed with:

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

If the bug involves a device, then please include device diagnostics from
Settings / Devices & Services / Tuya Local (your device) / "1 device"

Please check if there are messages from Tuya Local in the Home
Assistant log (Settings / System / Logs), and include those too.

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
