        This form is for reporting a **New Device**.  If you are looking for
        general help, including cases where you do not see anything in the log,
        see [Discussions](https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local/discussions).

        Thank you for reporting your unsupported device. Please provide as
        much information as you can. Because the developers are busy, new
        device requests will be prioritised as follows:

          1. Pull requests
          2. Issues with logs and QueryThingsDataModel API results or equivalent
          3. Issues with logs and enough dps info to make a useful config.
          4. Issues with logs and a tested config

        Please paste the Warning level log message containing a dps list

        Preferred data is QueryThingsDataModel API result from iot.tuya.com
        If you do not have access to iot.tuya.com, but have other ways of
        obtaining dps information, the minimum info required is the numeric
        dp id, name/description, data type, and for settable dps, the range
        for numeric dps, and the list of possible values for enum dps.

        links to manuals or even marketing webpages are useful.
